- Apply cream contour and blush directly on bare skin
- Lightly blend with damp sponge

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Can look patchy if overdone

**How to Do It Right:**
- Apply thin layer of cream blush first
- Apply foundation with light hand
- Add another thin layer of blush on top
- Blend thoroughly between layers

- Blend edges inward with Q-tip or finger
- Apply clear or sheer gloss only in center
- Keep liner close to natural lip line

**Products:** NYX Line Loud Pencil, Fenty Gloss Bomb Ice
