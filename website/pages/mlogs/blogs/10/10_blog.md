### Expert Tips from Lily Chen

We asked **Lily Chen**, pro makeup artist and digital beauty coach, to weigh in on which TikTok trends are practical ‚Äî and which to skip:

- **‚ÄúUnderpainting is legit ‚Äî it‚Äôs just contouring *before* foundation for a softer blend.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúBlush sandwich is fine if you use light layers. But too much = patchy mess.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúAvoid at-home brow lamination unless you‚Äôre trained ‚Äî overprocessing damages brow hairs.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúSocks as curling tools? Honestly, works better than you‚Äôd expect for heat-free styling.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúGlass skin is achievable, but not with 5 layers of glow serum. Hydration and light makeup = same effect.‚Äù**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### How to Try TikTok Trends ‚Äî the Right Way

#### 1. **Underpainting Technique (Beginner Level)**  
- Apply cream contour and blush directly on **bare skin**.  
- Lightly blend with a damp sponge.  
- Apply **light coverage foundation or skin tint** on top with a brush.  
- Finish with highlighter and brows.

#### 2. **Ombr√© Lip Hack**  
- Outline lips with a **darker lip pencil** (brown, berry, etc.).  
- Blend the edges inward with a Q-tip or finger.  
- Apply **clear or sheer gloss** only in the center.

#### 3. **Glass Skin Finish (Fast Version)**  
- Cleanse ‚Üí mist ‚Üí hydrating serum ‚Üí light moisturizer.  
- Use **Dew Drops** or any glow primer.  
- Skip foundation or use a **sheer tint only where needed**.  
- Tap highlighter on high points for that glazed finish.

## Professional Techniques

- **Trend layering = minimal product**: TikTok trends can quickly become *too much*. Stick to *one hero product per step*.  
- **Blush-under-foundation works best with liquid or serum bases**, not matte formulas.  
- **Don‚Äôt mix actives unless you know what you‚Äôre doing**: Skin cycling only works if you balance exfoliation with hydration.  
- **Use your fingers**: A lot of viral looks blend better (and faster) with finger heat ‚Äî especially for dewy products.  
- **Document your results**: TikTok is visual. If you‚Äôre experimenting, take before/after pics to see what *actually* flatters you.
