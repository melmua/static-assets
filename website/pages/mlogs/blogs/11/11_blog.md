## 🎯 Understanding Hair Behavior

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">

*Professional styling starts with understanding your hair's unique characteristics*

</div>

The foundation of professional hair styling is understanding hair behavior and working with its natural properties:

### 🎯 Key Hair Characteristics

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e0e7ff 0%, #c7d2fe 100%); padding: 20px; border-radius: 12px; border-left: 4px solid #6366f1;">

| Characteristic | What It Means | How to Work With It |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Texture** | Fine, medium, or coarse hair strands | Fine hair needs lighter products, coarse hair can handle more |
| **Density** | How many hair strands per square inch | High density needs more product, low density needs less |
| **Porosity** | How well hair absorbs and retains moisture | High porosity needs protein, low porosity needs moisture |
| **Growth Direction** | Natural direction hair grows from scalp | Work with growth patterns for natural-looking styles |
| **Elasticity** | How much hair can stretch and return | Healthy hair has good elasticity, damaged hair breaks |

**Key Techniques:**
- **Lift & Pull:** For root volume, lift section vertically while drying
