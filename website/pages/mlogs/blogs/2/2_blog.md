## Key Points

### Overview of Skincare Routines

The Korean skincare philosophy focuses on *nourishment over quick fixes*. Rather than harsh treatments, it emphasizes gentle, hydrating steps to maintain skin health from within. The famous 10-step routine isn’t about using more products — it's about using the *right* ones in the *right* order.

**Here’s a quick rundown of the routine:**

1. Oil Cleanser  
2. Foam/Water-Based Cleanser  
3. Exfoliator  
4. Toner  
5. Essence  
6. Serum/Ampoule  
7. Sheet Mask  
8. Eye Cream  
9. Moisturizer  
10. Sunscreen (AM only)

Each step builds on the last to hydrate, treat, and protect your skin.

### Expert Tips from Sarah Kim

We asked **Sarah Kim**, Seoul-based esthetician and founder of “Skin by Sarah,” to share her golden rules:

- **“Double cleansing is non-negotiable. Even if you don’t wear makeup, oil cleansers lift out sunscreen and sebum better than anything else.”**
- **“Layer hydration — think of it like watering a plant. A spritz of essence preps your skin to absorb serums more effectively.”**
- **“Never skip SPF. UV rays are the #1 cause of premature aging. Even on cloudy days or indoors.”**
- **“Don’t rush your routine. Take 30 seconds after applying each product to let it absorb. Pat gently — don’t rub!”**
