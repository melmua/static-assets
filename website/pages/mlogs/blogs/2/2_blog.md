## 🎯 Understanding the Korean Philosophy

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">

*The Korean skincare philosophy focuses on nourishment over quick fixes*

The Korean approach to skincare is built on fundamental principles that prioritize skin health:

| **Layering** | Multiple thin layers over one thick layer | Better absorption and hydration |
| **pH Balance** | Maintaining skin's natural acid mantle | Prevents irritation and breakouts |
| **Gentle Care** | Nurturing skin rather than fighting it | Reduces inflammation and damage |
| **Consistency** | Daily ritual over occasional treatments | Builds long-term skin health |
| **Prevention** | Protecting skin before problems arise | Maintains youthful appearance longer |
