## What Makes a Great Foundation

![Foundation Review Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melmua/static-assets/main/website/pages/mlogs/blogs/3/images/blog3_fnd2.jpg)

When we evaluate luxury foundations, we look beyond the brand name and focus on what actually matters:

### üéØ Key Evaluation Criteria

| Factor | What We Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Coverage** | Light, buildable, or full coverage options |
| **Finish** | Matte, natural, radiant, or satin |
| **Longevity** | 8+ hours of wear without touch-ups |
| **Ingredients** | Skincare benefits and skin-friendly formulas |
| **Performance** | How it looks in different lighting and weather |

## Expert Insights

### üí¨ Emily's No-BS Foundation Rules

> **"Don't assume expensive means better ‚Äî your skin type always comes first."**

> **"Luxury brands are great at skin-like finishes, but you still need to prep your skin correctly."**

> **"Foundations with skincare benefits are worth the splurge ‚Äî look for ones with hyaluronic acid, peptides, or squalane."**

> **"Always test in natural light and wear it for a day before committing."**
