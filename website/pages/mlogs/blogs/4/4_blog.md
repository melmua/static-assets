### Expert Tips from Jessica Lee

We spoke to **Jessica Lee**, veteran MUA and red carpet consultant, about the principles behind 2025’s Met Gala glam:

- **“This year was about elevation and roots — not trends for the sake of trends.”**  
- **“Glossy skin, radiant tones, and textured hair were used not as decoration, but as narrative.”**  
- **“Monochromatic looks ruled — berry lids with matching cheeks and lips created unity.”**  
- **“Foundations with undertone precision made melanin pop without flattening skin’s natural depth.”**
