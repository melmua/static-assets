## Key Points

### Overview of Advanced Techniques

Advanced contouring goes beyond the basics. It involves:

- **Face shape-specific sculpting**  
- **Light source simulation**  
- **Micro-contouring** for detail areas like nose and jaw  
- **Undertone-aware shading**  
- **Strategic use of cream vs powder textures**

While beginner contouring focuses on creating shadows, **advanced techniques aim to replicate how light and shadow naturally fall on the face**, giving it lift, structure, and balance ‚Äî *without harsh lines*.

### Expert Tips from Alex Thompson

We spoke to **Alex Thompson**, celebrity MUA and instructor at the Global Pro Makeup Academy, to break down what separates everyday contouring from pro-level work:

- **‚ÄúContour is not one-size-fits-all. What flatters a heart-shaped face won‚Äôt work the same on a round or long face.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúCream products blend into the skin and work well for dry or mature skin. Powders can be layered for control.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúAlways check your lighting. Contour under warm light looks natural, but under flash it needs more blending.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúCool-toned bronzers or taupes work best for actual sculpting ‚Äî not orange bronzers.‚Äù**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prep the Canvas  
- Moisturize and prime. A slightly dewy base helps cream contour blend better.  
- Apply your foundation ‚Äî ideally light to medium coverage so the contour doesn‚Äôt disappear or get muddy.

### Step 2: Identify Face Shape  
- **Round**: Focus on outer temples, under cheekbones, jawline.  
- **Square**: Soften corners ‚Äî contour under cheekbones and outer jaw.  
- **Heart**: Contour sides of forehead and bottom of chin to balance top-heavy shape.  
- **Oval**: Gentle contour under cheekbones and temples.

### Step 3: Map with Cream or Stick Contour  
- Use a cool-toned cream contour stick to mark:  
  - Under cheekbones  
  - Sides of the nose bridge  
  - Jawline (optional)  
  - Hairline (if needed)

### Step 4: Blend Strategically  
- Use a **damp sponge** or **dense angled brush** to push and blend the contour upwards ‚Äî *never downward*.  
- For nose contour: Use a small eyeshadow brush or smudge brush for better precision.

### Step 5: Set with Powder (Optional)  
- Use a sculpting powder to **lightly set** cream contour ‚Äî focus only on areas that get oily or need extra staying power.

## Professional Techniques

Here are some next-level tips to elevate your contour:

- **Reverse Contouring**: Apply concealer first under cheekbones, then contour above it for a lifted, editorial look.  
- **Contour Before Foundation**: A method where cream contour is applied under a sheer foundation layer for a *subtle, skin-like effect*.  
- **Undereye Sculpting**: Lightly contour the inner brow bone and upper nose bridge for subtle depth.  
- **Lip Contour**: Add a touch of contour under the bottom lip to create a fuller pout.  
- **Jawline Definition for Photos**: Blend contour under the chin and along the jawline into the neck for a seamless, sculpted profile.
