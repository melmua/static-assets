### Expert Tips from Sofia Martinez

We asked **Sofia Martinez**, runway makeup lead and creative consultant, to share her top tips for turning catwalk creativity into summer-ready reality:

- **‚ÄúLess is more, but light reflection is everything. Stick to cream textures in the heat ‚Äî powders can look dry.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúApply bold shades with a light hand. Use your fingers to soften edges for a lived-in, editorial feel.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúLayer hydration under your makeup to keep it fresh. Skincare and primer are your real base.‚Äù**  
- **‚ÄúGloss is back, but control it ‚Äî just the center of the lip, or a gloss-topper over pencil for definition.‚Äù**

## Professional Techniques

- **Layer hydration under makeup**: Start with a humectant-rich toner, then serum and gel cream. Let each layer absorb fully.  
- **Fix your base without powder**: Use setting spray between cream layers. This keeps things dewy but locked in.  
- **Sheer pigments = more control**: Use fingers or a damp sponge to apply watercolor shadows or blush.  
- **Skip heavy lashes**: Try tinted mascara or individual corner lashes for lift without weight.  
- **Summer touch-up tip**: Blot excess oil with tissue, then reapply cream blush or balm highlight ‚Äî no need to powder.
