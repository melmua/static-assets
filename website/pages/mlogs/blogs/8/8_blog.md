### Expert Tips from Lauren Wilson

We asked **Lauren Wilson**, celebrity hair stylist and salon owner, to share her expert advice:

- **“Always match the tool to the job and your hair type — using a flat iron for curls? Only if it has curved edges.”**  
- **“Invest in adjustable heat settings. One temperature doesn’t fit all — finer hair needs lower heat.”**  
- **“Prep is as important as styling. A heat protectant is not optional — it’s hair sunscreen.”**  
- **“Clean your tools regularly. Product buildup on hot plates and bristles can cause uneven heat and even breakage.”**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### How to Style Hair Using Core Tools

#### 1. **Prep**
- Always begin with clean, detangled, slightly damp or dry hair.
- Apply a **heat protectant** spray or cream evenly from root to ends.

#### 2. **Blow Drying**
- Use a round brush and **blow dryer with nozzle** for sleek volume.
- Dry in sections, always pointing the airflow **down the shaft** to reduce frizz.

#### 3. **Straightening**
- Use a flat iron on **low to medium heat (250°F–375°F)** depending on hair type.
- Take **thin sections** and glide slowly but steadily for smooth results.
- For curved ends, twist your wrist slightly inward or outward on the last inch.

#### 4. **Curling**
- Use a **wand or barrel size** based on desired curl:  
  - 1” for tight curls  
  - 1.25–1.5” for waves  
  - 2” for soft bends  
- Wrap hair away from the face for a modern look.
- Hold for 5–8 seconds, then let curls cool in your palm before releasing.

#### 5. **Finishing**
- Run fingers or a wide-tooth comb through waves.
- Add lightweight serum or hairspray depending on desired hold.

## Professional Techniques

- **Clamp-Free Curling**: Use a wand instead of a curling iron for more natural texture.
- **Flat Iron Waves**: Twist your flat iron 180° as you glide downward for easy beach waves.
- **Volume Boost**: Flip your head upside down when blow drying the roots.
- **Cool Shot Trick**: After heat styling, use your blow dryer’s cool shot to lock in shape.
- **Cleaning Tools**: Use rubbing alcohol or a vinegar-water mix on plates and bristles monthly.
