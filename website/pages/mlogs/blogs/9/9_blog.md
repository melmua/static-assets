We asked **Emma Brown**, celebrity makeup artist and creator of the “Effortless Skin School,” to share her fast-beauty philosophy:

- **“Start with multitaskers. Use products that work on lips, cheeks, and even eyes.”**  
- **“Cream textures are faster — no brushes needed. Just blend with your fingers.”**  
- **“Focus on three zones: skin, eyes, lips. If those are fresh, everything looks pulled together.”**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### ⏱️ The 5-Minute Routine Breakdown

#### 🔹 Minute 1: Skin  
- Apply a **tinted moisturizer** with your hands for light coverage.  
- Dab **concealer** under eyes and around the nose — blend with fingers.

#### 🔹 Minute 2: Cheeks & Lips  
- Use a **multi-stick or cream blush**. Tap onto cheeks and blend upward with fingers.  
- Apply the same product to lips for a monochrome look.

#### 🔹 Minute 3: Brows  
- Use a **tinted brow gel** to brush brows up and fill gaps in one step.

#### 🔹 Minute 4: Eyes  
- Curl lashes (optional).  
- Swipe on **one coat of mascara** — focus on the roots for lift.

#### 🔹 Minute 5: Glow

- Mist with a hydrating setting spray if available.

💡 **Bonus Tip**: Use leftover blush on eyelids for a soft, tonal wash of color.

## Professional Techniques

- **Finger blending is key**: Your body heat melts the product faster than any tool.  
- **Monochromatic color = less thinking, more glow**: Match your blush, lip, and lid.  
- **Strategic concealing > full coverage**: Focus only where you actually need it.  
- **Set smart, not everywhere**: If you're oily, tap powder only on the T-zone.  
- **Glow last**: Applying glow products at the end makes them stand out more without getting covered up.
